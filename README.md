# Natural-Language-Processing-Project
Welcome to the NLP Project for this section of the course. In this NLP project you will be attempting to classify Yelp Reviews into 1 star or 5 star categories based off the text content in the reviews. This will be a simpler procedure than the lecture, since we will utilize the pipeline methods for more complex tasks.
